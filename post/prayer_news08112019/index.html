    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In the account of the rich ruler in the Gospel of Mark the disciples were shocked to learn from Jesus that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.  &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo; they asked.  What great reassurance Jesus gave His disciples:</p>

<p><strong>With man it is impossible, but not with God.  For all things are possible with God.</strong> (10:27 &ndash;ESV)</p>

<p>After that Peter pointed out that he and the other disciples had left &ldquo;everything&rdquo; to follow him.  I don&rsquo;t know his motives for saying this, but it seems to me that he may have been fishing for more or greater reassurance.  Whatever the case <em>that</em> is what he got:</p>

<p><strong>Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold <em>now in this time</em>, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.</strong> (10:29-30 &ndash;ESV, emphasis mine)</p>

<p>This past week, beginning August 5th, the Stratton clan in Japan had the wonderful opportunity to join VBS at Miyakonojo Christian Center in Miyazaki prefecture.  During the week our family had the pleasure of spending time with the Sadowitz family, a group of Filipino brothers and sisters, as well as a young man from Uganda, not to mention about forty elementary-age kids.  (We also made a few other new friends along the way.)  It was an incredible week for our family as we watched the Sadowitz family and the young people mentioned above&ndash;all high schoolers&ndash;pour out their hearts in a labor of love in order to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with the little ones.</p>

<p>Our time in Miyakonojo was a reminder of Jesus&rsquo; promise to His followers, both then and <em>now</em>, of God&rsquo;s provision for them as they leave behind people, places, and possessions for the sake of the gospel.  God provides all that we need (and beyond) including the blessings of houses: We had a great place to stay! And of brothers:  We spent time with new and old brothers in Christ.  And of sisters and mothers:  More of the same!  And of children:  We met dozens of them!  And of lands:  I believe pools, beaches, and Miyakonojo Christian Center count.  No, there were not any perceptible persecutions, but I believe they will come and serve a beautiful purpose at the right time.  And&hellip; we look forward to eternal life!  We pray that many of the little ones who got to hear the good news will respond with repentance and faith and also join us in our assured hope of eternal life.</p>

<p><strong>Praise:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for God&rsquo;s continued provision:  between the generosity of the Sadowitz family and our Siloam church family, we were able to spend the week in Miyakonojo well provided for and come home encouraged</li>
<li>for our time with the brothers and sisters in Miyakonojo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Pray:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for our spiritual growth<br /></li>
<li>for wisdom for Azusa and me as we try to find the best possible route to getting a &ldquo;green card&rdquo; for Azusa</li>
<li>for our children as they adjust to our/their new lifestyle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We thank you for your prayer support!</strong></p>
