    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Some people are afraid of spiders.  I don&rsquo;t quite get it.  Some people are afraid of snakes.  OK, I can understand that one a little better.  Some people are afraid of paperwork.  That&rsquo;s me.  Paperwork sends me into a cold sweat.  I&rsquo;m just fine with spiders and snakes, though people have good reason to fear some species at least.  But paperwork?  Yep, I have actually gotten the shakes as if I were experiencing stagefright when beginning to fill out paperwork.  The i130 form began the same way.</p>

<p>Since June, when Azusa was once again denied a non-immigrant visa for entry into the U.S., we have been waiting, hoping, praying, and wondering what to next.  We <em>finally</em> decided to go ahead without an attorney and seek our only known option left for Azusa:  a green card.</p>

<p>A week or so ago I began to fill out the petition forms that I need to send in in order for Azusa to begin the application process for a green card, the i130 and accompanying forms.  It&rsquo;s embarassing, but I did in fact experience something like performance anxiety when I began to fill them out.  However, as with most things that I know I must do, the Lord began to give me peace in my heart as I began to move forward.</p>

<p>Azusa and I have started to gather the other paperwork and evidence that we need to send in along with petition.  According to the government website, the average wait time for an answer to the petition is about ten and a half months!  Then, if accepted, Azusa will need to go through the process of actually applying for a green card, which is quite involved.  Just thinking about these things can be overwhelming and discouraging IF we allow them to be.</p>

<p>The photo of the Japanese sparrow (courtesy of Kei) at the top of the page reminded me of Jesus&rsquo; words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t five sparrows sold for two pennies?  Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.  In fact, even the hairs of your head are numbered.  Do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows. (Luke 12:6-7 — NET)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The photo also reminded me of the song, &ldquo;His Eye is on the Sparrow,&rdquo; one which I never cared for musically (sorry) but which lyrically is a great encouragement!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 Why should I feel discouraged?
Why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
and long for heaven and home,
when Jesus is my portion?
My constant friend is he:
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me;
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me.</p>

<p>Refrain:
I sing because I’m happy, (I’m happy)
I sing because I’m free, (I’m free)
for his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me.</p>

<p>2 “Let not your heart be troubled,”
his tender word I hear,
and resting on his goodness,
I lose my doubts and fears;
though by the path he leadeth
but one step I may see:
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me;
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me. [Refrain]</p>

<p>3 Whenever I am tempted,
whenever clouds arise,
when song gives place to sighing,
when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to him;
from care he sets me free:
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me;
his eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he watches me. [Refrain]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Azusa and I continue to learn to trust in the One who looks upon the least of his creatures with kindness.  His plan is perfect and His ways are always right.  We can put our faith in the One who is faithful.</p>

<p><strong>Praise:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for God&rsquo;s continued provision</li>
<li>for our time together as a family</li>
<li>for daily reminders of God&rsquo;s love</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Pray:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for the growth of our brothers and sisters at <a href="https://shiroamu.life">Siloam Church</a></li>
<li>for perseverance in completing paperwork</li>
<li>for our spiritual growth<br /></li>
<li>for our children as they learn to be responsible for their own actions and attitudes of heart</li>
<li>for continued provision</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We thank you for your prayer support!</strong></p>
