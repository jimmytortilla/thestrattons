    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      &ldquo;Daddy, don&rsquo;t make me fall,&rdquo; my four-year-old son begged me a number of times as we crossed the suspension bridge in Aya-cho in the mountains of Miyazaki Prefecture this past week. He was really frightened. At 142 meters (465 feet) above the gorge I felt a bit giddy myself.
&ldquo;Daddy won&rsquo;t let you fall,&rdquo; I repeatedly tried to reassure my little son. But he found it difficult to believe my words of comfort as he felt the bridge sway and bounce beneath his feet, that is, until I carried him in my arms.

      The photo above was taken this morning (2&frasl;18) at Kumabe Castle ruins in Yamaga.
About a ten-minute walk from our home/church building stands a massive Buddha. It measures about one-hundred feet high and more than thirty feet wide. Though perhaps not strictly made of stone, you might say that it is a dead stone. It certainly has no life in itself, no power to meet the needs of the people who come to it, no sight in its ever-staring eyes, and no words to speak from its unmoving lips.

      The family Christmas photo above, like so many photos, is somewhat misleading. Here&rsquo;s what I mean: It was the end of a long day when we arranged ourselves for the picture. We were tired and some of us were a bit irritable. It probably didn&rsquo;t help that it took ten or fifteen shots to get one that we agreed was good enough to make public. A number of the of the shots were pretty funny to look at later&ndash;at least to ourselves&ndash;as some of our faces revealed impatience, disinterest, or annoyance.

      Back at the end of September I walked up the hill near our church building and reflected a little upon the mandarin orange (or tangerine) orchard that was full of weeds and decaying trees. The reason for its pitiable state was a lack of workers to tend it. As beautiful as the view was from the orchard (seen here), the orchard itself was rather depressing to look at. It reminded me of how great the need for workers (disciple-making believers) is in Japan.

      Some people are afraid of spiders. I don&rsquo;t quite get it. Some people are afraid of snakes. OK, I can understand that one a little better. Some people are afraid of paperwork. That&rsquo;s me. Paperwork sends me into a cold sweat. I&rsquo;m just fine with spiders and snakes, though people have good reason to fear some species at least. But paperwork? Yep, I have actually gotten the shakes as if I were experiencing stagefright when beginning to fill out paperwork.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Personally, I (Nate) think that late September to mid-October is the most beautiful time of the year in Japan: The HIGANBANA (pronounced &ldquo;he-gone-bonna&rdquo;), beautiful red or sometimes white flowers on long green stems, line the borders of the golden rice fields. The air is clean and fresh; and puffy, white clouds float along in the deep blue sky. The temperature is pleasantly warm, and, unless there is a typhoon, it is sunny almost every day.

      Late last month Azusa, the kids, and I traveled a few hours by highway from Kumamoto to just about the southernmost tip of Kyushu. We spent four days and three nights in Ibusuki (pronounced ee-boo-ski)&ndash;famous for geothermal sand-baths&ndash;for the purpose of fellowship with ABWE missionaries and a few others as well. What a treat it was for us to enjoy some time with missionaries! This time, however, none of the Stratton family chose to be buried alive in the hot sand.

        Weeds and Snakes

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Summer in southwestern Japan is hot and humid. With highs generally in the mid to upper 90s, lows in the upper 70s to mid 80s, and frequent rains, the weeds absolutely thrive. In a week or two they can grow more than a foot. As such, during this season much time and energy is spent by farmers and property owners cutting down the weeds with various machines, the most common of which are viscious-looking, gasoline-powered weed-whackers with something akin to circular saw blades instead of nylon lines on their rotating heads.

      In the account of the rich ruler in the Gospel of Mark the disciples were shocked to learn from Jesus that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo; they asked. What great reassurance Jesus gave His disciples:
With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.

      We&rsquo;ve moved &hellip; again! This week&rsquo;s move makes the second move since the end of March when we moved into the Waifu House.
These past several months have been busy with a lot of cleaning, sorting, disposing of, packing, and moving&ndash;all times two! It has been a time for all of us to realize how much things can be a hindrance. Azusa and I in particular have felt at times ashamed of how many unnecessary items we have collected over the years.
